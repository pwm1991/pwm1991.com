### Charlotte Tilbury - current

At the moment I'm working on deploying Snowplow, a real-time behavioural data product to enable personalisation on the website. This has involved building models, designing schema and CI/CD. Primarily written so far in SQL (obvs) and Node/JavaScript. I'm also standing up Google Tag Manager Server to offload frontend tracking.

I also support on the Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager deployments. I work with squads to implement tracking on features as they come up, design dashboards in Looker, and model data out in BQ for consumption.

I'm really interested in coupling BI together from schema to product, and automating model development as much as possible.

### Cancer Research UK

I spent a lot of time talking about cookies - and not the good kind - by implementing OneTrust. I refactored a lot of GTM Containers, too.

### The Royal Society

I wrote the email marketing strategy, brought in a comms grid and processes to send email from a central team (including hiring an email marketer).

I worked on Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, wrote a question library to standardise surveys and forms, and setup a mini-data warehouse to facilitate reporting using SQL Server and Power BI.

### Liberal Democrats

Ran the Liberal Democrats's email marketing program during the 2015 General Election and the Brexit referendum. Collected a bunch of email addresses, raised a fair amount of money. Lost both elections - take from that what you will.
