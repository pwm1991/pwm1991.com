I work on web analytics and personalisation at Charlotte Tilbury.

My day-to-day activities include modelling, building pipelines, asking interesting (to me at least) questions, and setting up marketing analytics. At the moment I'm building out Snowplow.

I have a dog called <a href="/olive">Olive</a>, an allotment with barely anything on it (thanks, sky god) and a fantastic partner of nearly 11 years, Amy. We all live in London.
