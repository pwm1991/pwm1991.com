This has involved building models, designing schema and CI/CD. Primarily written so far in SQL (obvs) and Node/JavaScript. I&amp;rsquo;m also standing up Google Tag Manager Server to offload frontend tracking.
I also support on the Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager deployments. I work with squads to implement tracking on features as they come up, design dashboards in Looker, and model data out in BQ for consumption.</description></item><item><title>Olive</title><link>https://www.pwm1991.com/olive/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 20:16:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pwm1991.com/olive/</guid><description>So you&amp;rsquo;re more interested in cute dog pics?
